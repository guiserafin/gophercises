Hello, world

This is my solution for the Quiz Game exercise available at [Gophercises](gophercises.com)

# Help

You can run the program by typing `./quiz` in your terminal.

If you want to see which flags you can use, just type `./quiz -h` or `./quiz --help`, so you can see the flags available, their usage and default value

# Usage of `./quiz`:
  -csv=(string): <br>
        a csv file in the format of 'question,answer' (default "problems.csv") <br>
  -time=(int): <br>
        time to answer the question in seconds (default 30)
